The discovery of GW170817 and GRB 170817A in tandem with AT 2017gfo cemented the connection between neutron star mergers, short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and kilonovae. To investigate short GRB observations in the context of diverse kilonova behavior, we present a comprehensive optical and near-infrared (NIR) catalog of 85 bursts discovered over 2005-2020 on timescales of ≲12 days. The sample includes previously unpublished observations of 23 bursts, and encompasses both detections and deep upper limits. We identify 11.8% and 15.3% of short GRBs in our catalog with upper limits that probe luminosities lower than those of AT 2017gfo and a fiducial NSBH kilonovae model (for pole-on orientations), respectively. We quantify the ejecta masses allowed by the deepest limits in our catalog, constraining blue and `extremely blue' kilonova components of 14.1% of bursts to Mej≲0.01−0.1M⊙. The sample of short GRBs is not particularly constraining for red kilonova components. Motivated by the large catalog as well as model predictions of diverse kilonova behavior, we investigate altered search strategies for future follow-up to short GRBs. We find that ground-based optical and NIR observations on timescales of ≳2 days can play a significant role in constraining more diverse outcomes. We expect future short GRB follow up efforts, such as from the {\it James Webb Space Telescope}, to expand the reach of kilonova detectability to redshifts of z≈1.

Dark matter-only simulations are able to produce the cosmic structure of a ΛCDM universe, at a much lower computational cost than more physically motivated hydrodynamical simulations. However, it is not clear how well smaller substructure is reproduced by dark matter-only simulations. To investigate this, we directly compare the substructure of galaxy clusters and of surrounding galaxy groups in hydrodynamical and dark matter-only simulations. We utilise TheThreeHundred project, a suite of 324 simulations of galaxy clusters that have been simulated with hydrodynamics, and in dark matter-only. We find that dark matter-only simulations underestimate the number density of galaxies in the centres of groups and clusters relative to hydrodynamical simulations, and that this effect is stronger in denser regions. We also look at the phase space of infalling galaxy groups, to show that dark matter-only simulations underpredict the number density of galaxies in the centres of these groups by about a factor of four. This implies that the structure and evolution of infalling groups may be different to that predicted by dark matter-only simulations. Finally, we discuss potential causes for this underestimation, considering both physical effects, and numerical differences in the analysis.
